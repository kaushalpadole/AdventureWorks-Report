# AdventureWorks-Report
This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project focused on analyzing sales, products, and customer data for AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company. The project transforms raw data into actionable insights through a multi-stage ETL and visualization process.

# Business Problem 
Adventure Works, a retail company, wants to:

1. Monitor overall business performance (Revenue, Profit, Orders, Return Rate)
2. Identify top customers and high-value segments
3. Track product-level performance vs targets
4. Analyze return trends and category performance
5. Support management with data-driven decisions

The objective was to build an interactive dashboard solution to provide real-time business insights across executive, customer, and product levels.

# Methodology

## Step 1: Data Preparation (Power Query Editor)

- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized column formats (date, currency, categories)
- Created calculated columns where necessary
- Transformed raw tables into structured fact & dimension tables

## Step 2: Data Modeling

- Built a star schema model:

- Created relationships between:
  - Fact Sales tables
  - Customer Dimension tables
  - Product Dimension tables
  - Ensured proper cardinality and filtering direction

## Step 3: DAX Calculations

Created a measure table consisting of key measures such as:

1. Total Revenue
2. Total Profit
3. Total Orders
4. Return Rate
5. Revenue per Customer
6. Monthly Revenue & Profit Trends
7. Target vs Actual KPIs
8. Adjusted Profit (Price Adjustment Simulation)
9. Top N Customers & Products

Used advanced DAX functions like,

CALCULATE, SUMX, DIVIDE, FILTER, ALL, DATESYTD

## Step 4: Visualization (Power BI Report)

Built 3 interactive dashboards and 3 AI powered advanced analytics:
